# Delivery Driver!
Top-Down 2D driving game, made in Unity

Oh no! A truck full of packages seems to have dropped them all over the neighborhood. You need to help collect them from the road and drop them off to customers. Hurry, some people are already wandering into the street, help your neighbors!

- customers/package drop offs (yellow squares)
- packages (purple squares)
- car changes color to mimic packages color, when currently holding a package
- car can only carry one package at a time

- score per package drop off 
- exit menu at game end (way to exit/close application)
